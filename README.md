I love Paul Graham Essays however the design of the site made me feel so uncomfortable idk why i was tempted to make custom css for it. I was amazed at how images can be used as button using co-ordinates in html, paul is a genius. 
I really had a hard time customizing the tables as the whole site was built on table. So, I did not take up the challenge to make it responsible for other devices for me works like a charm.

How to use? In case I forgot

1. Download This extension: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld or anything that let's you add custom js and css to sites
2. add those css and js as following:

for index page

the url with ! in front is added to avoid overwriting the customizations made prior.

final results ðŸ”¥
